# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > It's an incredibly useful and intuitive system for sharing code.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It makes folders. 

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > It's a sort of non-constant state to be in; commonly "hover" or "visited".

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Pinning down a very specific part of an element; to alter specific pieces of an element.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > It will conflict with other things too easily. 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Element; component (or command), value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > H1's are usually the focus of your site; and the concept of boxes is a very powerful one. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > it helps map out your site long before you even start coding. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > sometimes; depending on the size of the site. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > it makes your given element able to freely move about the space it has availible.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Width and Height, among other things.
