# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > async code runs line by line, waiting for given imputs; synchronous code runs as fast as it can in order. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > an element that triggers a function upon a change on a given element. 

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | its a surprisingly difficult acronym to find the meaning of; but it means that an api follows strict design and syntax requirements

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | a function that calls upon other functions on command

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | a boolean or string waiting for input; and if it comes back as false or with incorrect information it will promise as failed. 

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | onclick, onsubmit, onchange

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | application programming interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | set the function as 'async'ronous

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | it allows individual pieces of an application to access the same values and data in different ways. 

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | Bad Request; meaning you screwed up the data you asked for/gave.
